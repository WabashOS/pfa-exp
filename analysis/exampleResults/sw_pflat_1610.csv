# HW Config:
#   * pfa256 (agfi-0c63c859d9d62c53f)
#   * linklatency 1610
#
# Notes:
#   *This test is not deterministic. It requires a very precise HW and SW
#   configuration in order to reproduce. This is because it relies on
#   intentionally triggering a remote page fault. While the software
#   configuration is built deterministically, it is possible that minor changes
#   to the workload or non-determinism in the simulator may cause different
#   results.
#  * All values are valid in the SW test because we can measure each step
#   (unlike the PFA which does everything in HW)
