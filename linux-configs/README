This is a collection of standard PFA configurations for various tests.

# Usage
Most of the configs in this directory are derived from patches. To change a
basic option (nothing to do with the PFA), change one of the basic configs
(e.g. br, fed). To create an experiment or PFA configuration, change a patch
and run the applyPatches script in patches/.

If you're just starting out, do:
    cd patches/
    ./patchCfg.py ../br *.patch
    ./patchCfg.py ../fed *.patch


# Basic Configs
fed, br
These are good starting points for saving particular configurations.

# Full benchmark runs:
These are saved configs for particular experiments. The naming scheme is
{distro}-{platform}-{pfa configuration}.

## Distros:
* br: buildroot. Only contains a few basic benchmarks and manual tooling.
* fed: Fedora. Contains full automated run scripts, benchmark suites, and statistic recording.

## Platforms:
* em: Emulates all hardware, can run on qemu or vanilla firesim. 
* real: Uses real hw. Default configs assume client is in slot 0 and memory blade is in slot 1 (hard-coded MAC addresses).

## PFA Configurations:
* mb: Use memory blade directly. Baseline, no PFA stuff enabled (frontswap to rmem through memblade client)
* pfa: Use swap via the PFA

# One-Off Configs
* manual: basic config to goof around with and use for temporary stuff. Treat this kinda like a tmp.
* pflat: page-fault latency test. These are buildroot-based.
