This is a collection of standard PFA configurations for various tests.

# Basic Configs
fed, br
These are good starting points for saving particular configurations.

# Full benchmark runs:
These are saved configs for particular experiments. The naming scheme is
{platform}-{pfa configuration}.

## Platforms:
* em: Emulates all hardware, can run on qemu or vanilla firesim. 
* spike: Uses loopback MAC for rmem blade
* fs: Assumes node is running in slot 0, rmem blade is in slot 1

## PFA Configurations:
* base: Baseline, no PFA stuff enabled (frontswap to rmem through memblade client)
* pfa: Use swap via the PFA

# One-Off Configs
* testing: basic config to goof around with and use for temporary stuff
* pflat: page-fault latency test
